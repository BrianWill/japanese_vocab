# Learning Japanese through input

There are two key milestones on the path to acquiring a second language:

- Comprehension milestone: you are able to consume interesting content (text, audio, video, etc.) in the language with a reasonable degree of understanding and fluidity.
- Speaking milestone: you have sufficient listening skills and vocabulary to attempt non-trivial spoken communication.

The speaking miletone comes second because speaking rests upon a foundation of listening comprehension.

How long it takes to reach these milestones depends upon the distance between your own language and the target language. For a Spanish speaker learning Italian or *vice versa*, this might be as short as a few months. For an English speaker learning Japanese or *vice versa*, this easliy takes two years or even more.

> NOTE: For the special case of living in country with daily immersion, you can reach basic functional spoken Japanese in several months, but there will be large holes in your skills, especially with the written language. In any case, this pathway is not really relevant to the discussion because it's an unrealistic life circumstance for the vast majority of learners.

Once you reach these two milestones, the path forward is clear: consume tons of content and do lots of speaking practice. But the hard question is how to reach these milestones in the first place, especially for languages like Japanese that take a long time to acquire.

Here's my advise on how reach those milestones *via* listening and reading practice.

## Levels of listening and reading practice

Levels of listening and reading practice should be categorized based on how much you comprehend. In order from least understanding to most, the levels are:

### 1. Scanning for words and phrases

At this level, you catch isolated words, phrases, and perhaps occasional whole clauses or sentences, and you may often recognize the outline of many sentences (verb auxiliaries, conjunctions, and other connective words or phrases).

However, you're not able to follow what's happening sentence-to-sentence nor consistently discern the topic.

> *Something about a cow and magic beans. A giant is involved for some reason?*

### 2. Following the topic

You can follow the topic, but you're missing too many things to follow sentence-by-sentence.

> *Someone buys magic beans. There's a big plant, lots of climbing, and a castle. Also some clouds and a giant? Someone dies at the end?*

### 3. Partial understanding of the sentences

You can now understand the essence of many sentences, but details still get lost.

> *A kid gets magic beans. His mother is upset about a cow for some reason. Jack climbs a big plant that somehow appears. Jack finds a castle in the clouds and robs a giant.*

### 4. Full understanding of the sentences

You now catch basically all the information.

> *Oh I see, Jack traded the cow for the beans, and the plant grew from the beans which he tossed out the window.*

### 5. Full understanding of the nuance

You not only get all the concrete information conveyed, you understand the nuances like a native speaker. In Japanese, this would include things like the choice of end sentence particles or choice of pronouns or honorifics. (Japanese has a lot of 'coloring' options like this, meaning ways of changing the feel of a sentence without changing the concrete information.)

> *Jack is a disrepectful trickster comic hero who speaks in kansai dialect. The giant talks like a tough yakuza guy.*

## Reading while listening

Reading along with the transcript as you listen can help you understand more and stay engaged with the content. However, it's critical to also practice pure listening without text because the mental overhead of reading will distract your focus from the spoken language. Without listening-only practice, your listening comprehension development may be hindered or even stalled. (Besides, fluent reading ultimately rests on a foundation of the spoken language, so you're best off prioritizing your pure listening skills first anyway.)

## Word acquisition

1. acquire a phonetic memory of the word
1. map meaning to the phonetic memory of the word by experiencing the spoken word in meaningful contexts
1. map your phonetic memory of the word to the written word
1. integrate the word into your active vocabulary by using it
1. acquire nuances of the word (shades of meaning, connotations, colocations) through further encounters in the spoken and written language

(The process won't always follow this sequence strictly. In particular, the last two steps may overlap.)

### Phonetic memory of a word

human brains are remarkably good at absorbing the unique sound signature of a word, sometimes even with only a handful of exposures, and then you'll be able to fairly reliably pick these individual words out from a stream of unknown words and unparsable sentences.

Note that recognizing the sound of a word when you hear it does not translate automatically to recognizing the word in written form or being able to reproduce the sound reliably. For example, even if you reliably recognize 面白い when you hear it, you may not reliably be able to remember the exact sequence of syllables when you try to speak the word. (For English speakers, it's particularly easy to mix up A and O vowel sounds of Japanese words, or flip the order of two adjacent syllables.) So though speaking is built on a foundation of listening, reliably speaking individual words correctly may take some actual speaking practice.

Or for example, easy to mix up しっぱい (failure) with しんぱい (worry), particularly in this case because the meanings are somewhat related.

Also particularly accute in Japanese is the preponderance of homonyms. So you'll hear 放す and think that it's 話す, another word you may already know.

### Word meaning through experience

Translating in your head:

'おんがく? I've heard that word'

'おんがく? That means "music"'

Eventually you'll get to a point where you don't translate the word, but you still take a moment to consciously register it and perhaps repeat it to yourself in your head:

'おんがく? Oh yeah, おんがく'

Finally, you hear the word and just understand it automatically without conscious thought:

'おんがく’


For a long time, you'll likely have a large set of words that aren't fully acquired. Don't get frustrated when you catch yourself consciously translating or acknowleding a word that you know you've heard a thousand times already.

In fact, until you can listen to interesting content with a high degree of comprehension, many words will probably hover at the border of this final threshold. Only once the language is really useful to you such that you can actually consume content for the content's own sake will the vocabulary and language patterns become truly ingrained.

## Repeated listening practice

One effective form of practice is to repeatedly listen to a piece of content until you understand it without aid of a transcript or translation.

For such practice, the content should generally meet these criteria:

- The content should be monologues or dialogues by native speakers (not text-to-speech).
- The content should have an accurate transcript so that you can verify that you heard the words correctly and can easily look up any words or get a full translation.
- Especially in the beginner and intermediate stages, the content should generally be [“comprehensible input”](https://ellevationeducation.com/blog/teaching-comprehensible-input-definition-examples), meaning content targeted for non-native speakers.
- The content should be short, say 3 to 10 minutes long. The shorter, the easier it is to repeat. 
- The content should be sufficiently within your level that you understand at least 70-80% on your first listen.

After each repetition, you can look at the transcript if you need to verify your understanding and fill in gaps: lookup any unknown words, analyze the grammar, use machine translation, or whatever else it takes to fully understand the text.

You generally should repeat a piece of content no more than 3 or 4 times, and generally these repetitions should be spaced out by at least a few days.

If, after a few repetitions, you still have trouble following a piece of content, it was probably too difficult for listening practice at your current level. Don't worry--the exercise still had value--but consider picking simpler content for future practice.

> NOTE: Depending on the original speaking speed, you may be able to slow the playback rate to 70% or 80% speed while still maintaining reasonable audio quality. Don't feel guilty about doing this if it helps! Better to understand as much as you can than to let the words pass over you as a stream of noise.


## Intensive reading practice

In intensive reading, you analyze a text to get contextual exposure to new words, kanji, points of grammar, and language patterns. As you read, you look up every unknown word and puzzle out how all the words fit together, using translation tools and grammatical analysis or any other necessary means.

Because beginners and intermediate learners should prioritize listening comprehension, I recommend using transcripts of audio or video content so that you can also listen to the content spoken by a native speaker.

Intensive reading is an opportunity to reach above your current natural comprehension level, so the selected content should contain a good number of words and language patterns that you've never encountered before. Roughly, for every 5 minutes of audio or video, you want about 20 to 40 new words.

Because you are studying the text rather than naturally reading it, intensive reading is a slow process. For a 5 minute piece of audio or video, it often may take more than 30 minutes to study the first time you go through it. 

Like with all language practice, feel free to abandon a piece of intensive reading content at any time because it’s too hard, too easy, too boring, or you just feel like doing something else. Keep in mind that **your attention and interest is critical in language acquisition, so you should follow your own impulses**.

## Vocab drilling

For drilling, follow four rules:

1. **Drill only the words in stories you are currently repeating for listening and reading practice.**
2. **For words and kanji with multiple meanings and pronunciations, focus only on the meanings and pronunciations used in the stories.**
3. **Do not test yourself on the words**: drilling is an opportunity to get systematic repeated exposure, so just seeing and hearing the word with its definition is sufficient.
4. **Drill an individual word no more than 10-20 times total.** You most likely won't master a word after just 10 to 20 drills, but the goal of vocab drilling should not be to master words but rather to make the words more familiar.

Real mastery of words only comes through encounters in meaningful context, but by drilling words to a certain level of familiarity, each subsequent individual contextual encounter becomes much more impactful. In other words, drilling a word 'primes' you for when you later encounter it in your listening and reading practice or in the wild.

## Expectations

It's important to have the right expectations:

- For a long time, you wont understand most of what you encounter, and that which you do understand will often require conscious effort. “Natural” (automatic) understanding comes slowly and in pieces.
- As long as the language itself distracts you from focusing on the content of what you read and hear, your input consumption will be [*intensive* rather than *extensive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive_reading). This is not a matter of learning style or choice: the beginner simply cannot understand what they read or hear without looking up many words and consciously pondering how the words fit together, a slow process which consumes much mental energy and greatly limits how much language content can be encountered per day.
- Comfort with a particular topic and style of content doesn’t necessarily translate to comfort with other topics or styles.
- Accept that it will typically require many exposures before a word or kanji is fully memorized. Instead of consciously trying to force memorization, you should lean heavily on tools that make it quick and easy to look up words and kanji. **Depend upon reminders, not memorization.**
- A single aspect of a language cannot be truly mastered in isolation, and attempting to do so is generally inefficient. **Don’t try to master one aspect or “level” of the language before moving on.**

## Kana and Kanji

For how to approach the writing system, see [the writing system](writing.md).

## Random practice

In addition to systematic listening and reading practice, it's also good to consume content non-systematically with the goal of branching out and familiarizing yourself with parts of the language not usually found in comprehensible input.

So for random practice, you should consume audio, video, or text of various kinds and a variety of levels. Depending on the level, you may understand anywhere from 10% to 100% of what you consume. Reaching above your level exposes you to new vocabulary and grammar, while revisiting lower levels helps develop the ease and fluidity with which you process the language.

Unlike with systematic practice, these random pieces of content will be consumed only once, and for the most part, you should let anything you don't understand pass you by.

## TV and movies

In theory, TV shows and movies are a very appealing way to learn a language, but in practice, most TV and movies are inhospitable for beginner and intermediate learners due to several factors:

- Use of expansive vocabulary
- Use of advanced grammar
- Use of slang and colloquial speech
- Accents and speech quirks
- Archaic and formal speech
- Shouting, whispering, murmuring, mumbling
- Crosstalk
- Loud music and sound effects over dialogue

Furthermore, subtitles are problematic:

- A beginner or intermediate learner often won't know enough vocabulary or kanji to get even the gist of the story from Japanese subtitles.
- Just turning off subtitles isn't a great option either because a beginner or intermediate learner watching without subtitles would usually miss most of what is being said and wouldn't be able to follow the story.
- It's hard to concentrate on the Japanese audio while reading English subtitles (in fact, processing two languages at once is extremely difficult even if you already have mastered both languages). Furthermore, to the extent that parts of a Japanese and English sentence correspond, they tend to do so in reverse order, so for longer sentences, the part of the English translation currently displayed on screen often doesn't match what is currently being said in the Japanese audio. On top of this, translators often take large liberties, such that the English subtitltes do not accurately convey the original meaning or the way in which the original meaning was expressed.
- Most video sources don't provide the option to display Japanese and English subtitles simulteously (and besides, again, processing two written languages adds even more mental overhead that distracts from listening).

Sadly then, beginner and intermediate learners can't just watch TV and movies as normal to get much language value from them. What can work, though, is using short (2 to 5 minute) excerpts from shows and movies for repeated practice. The chosen excerpts should generally have these qualities:

- Avoid the adverse factors listed above: heavy accents, use of slang, shouting, dialogue drowned out in the sound mix, *etc.* Look for extended dialogue scenes where the characters calmly take turns saying their lines.
- Accurate subtitles should be available in both Japanese and English, preferably in a form where both can be displayed simultaneously and copy-pasted (useful when you want to get a machine translation).
- It helps if the dialogue scenes have a modicum of visual interest. The images don't actually have to relate directly to what's being said: rather, they just need to provide visual cues that help you track where you are in the dialogue. Even just regularly-paced camera cuts between the characters can help a great deal.

Unfortunately, the TV and movies that fit these criteria may not be your favorites or even in your preferred genres. Particularly in anime, there's almost an inverse relationship between quality and appropriateness for learners: the better the anime, often the harder it is to understand due to diverse, complex dialogue, extended action set pieces with shouting and loud sounds and music, and other adverse qualities. So until you reach an advanced level, you may have to venture outside of your normal zone of interest to find appropriate content.

Because TV and movies are "native" content rather than "comprehensible input" designed explicitly for learners, they do not fit exactly in the listening and reading practice dichotomy. Even the easiest TV and movie content will generally have many new words and phrases for a beginner or intermediate learner, so you probably will need to fully analyze the transcript a few times to fully understand it. However, the whole point of using this content is for listening, so you should also watch each excerpted story multiple times without subtitles.

Full understanding may require more repetitions than normal listening practice, but feel free to drop a story once it bores you, even if you never fully "master" the content. For example, if you only understand 30% of a story on your first listen, maybe you'll understand 70-80% after several repetitions, but reaching 100% may require dozens of additional repetitions. Rather than bang your head against this wall, you're probably better off moving on to other content. Don't worry: the exercise still has great value even when you fall short of full understanding.

## Grammar study

The value of explicit grammar knowledge in acquiring a language is highly debated. The obvious demerits are:

- Conscious thinking about grammar while speaking or listening requires too much mental overhead and in fact only really steals your focus.
- The grammar of all natural human languages have parts that are messy and murky.
- Accurate, complete grammar information is hard to find.

On the plus side: 

- When reading, grammar can help you break down sentences to understand things above your current "natural" comprehension level.
- When writing, grammar can help you construct valid sentences above your "natural" speaking level.
- Knowledge of grammar can give you comfort or even confidence by putting rational bounds on the language. Without any knowledge of grammar, a language seems choatic and untamable.
- Many of the most common words in a language have *functions* more than *meanings*. For example in English, the articles "a" and "the" do not refer to any person, place, or thing like a noun, nor any action like a verb, nor even any manner or context of action like an adverb, and many other languages have no equivalents or near equivalents of articles. So good luck explaining these words without describing how they are used! To describe the functions of words is to explain grammar, so in some sense, at least basic grammar knowledge is inescapable.

My recommendation then is:

- DO learn grammatical concepts
- do NOT memorize grammatical facts and tables
- do NOT practice points of grammar

In other words, its useful to understand grammar as best you can, but attempting to memorize and practice gramar, such as verb conjugations, is more frustrating than helpful. Instead, you want to internalize grammar patterns through lots of repeated exposure to real language, *i.e.* lots of input. Only this kind of internalization will help you actually put grammar into practice.

## Language partners

An increasingly popular practice in recent years is pairing up with a "language partner", a native speaker of your target language who is also learning your native language. The usual idea is that language partners will meet (perhaps in person but more commonly online) on a regular basis and take turns holding a conversation in each other's languages.

This is surely a great way to practice speaking, but as discussed at the start, beginning and intermediate learners generally lack the required vocabulary and listening comprehension skills to even attempt holding a basic conversation.

An interesting question then is what else beginner and intermediate learners could do with a language partner that might be effective. One thing I'd like to try (but haven't yet had the opportunity) is, rather than holding *conversations* with a language partner, instead do some kind of exercise or game that prompts *communication* with a language partner, but with both people only speaking their own native language. So rather than practicing speaking, the goal would be to just practice listening.

There are many possible exercises or games that might work well for this, but probably the simplest would be if both parties brought a story for the other person to read aloud. For example, if I bring my partner a story in Japanese, they would read it aloud to me sentence-by-sentence, and after each sentence, I would attempt to give them my translation in English. Both my partner and I could ask each other questions and prompt each other for clarification, but I would stick to speaking English while they speak Japanese (except perhaps when we prompt each other about specific words, *e.g.* 'What does X mean?'). Before moving on to the next sentence, we would check a proper translation to make sure we both understood correctly.

This listening-only approach would have at least a few key advantages over conversation practice:

- Removing the requirement to speak the target language makes the activity more accessible at lower levels, and for many people it would induce less anxiety.
- One reason finding a language partner is quite difficult is because it requires that both people are ready to start speaking, something which take several months or more of study. In contrast, basic listening is something that learners can try in the first month or even on the first day.
- Both participants get practice throughout the whole session, not just when the conversation switches to their target language. Even when my partner reads my story in Japanese, they are getting English input from me when I give my translation and ask them questions. Hopefully then they're less liable to feel impatient while waiting for me to read their story in English.
