# Learning Japanese through input

There are two key milestones on the path to acquiring a second language:

1. You are able to consume interesting content (text, audio, video, etc.) in the language with a reasonable degree of understanding and fluidity.
2. You have sufficient listening skills and vocabulary to attempt non-trivial spoken communication.

The second miletone generally depends upon the first because speaking rests upon a foundation of listening.

How long it takes to reach these milestones depends upon the distance between your own language and the target language. For a Spanish speaker learning Italian or *vice versa*, this might be as short as a few months. For an English speaker learning Japanese or *vice versa*, this easliy takes two years or even more.

> NOTE: For the special case of living in country with daily immersion, you can reach basic functional spoken Japanese in several months, but there will be large holes in your skills, especially with the written language. Besides, this pathway is not really relevant to the discussion because it's an unrealistic life circumstance for the vast majority of learners.

Once you reach these two milestones, the path forward is clear: consume tons of content and do lots of speaking practice. But how do you reach these milestones in the first place? That's the hard question, especially for languages like Japanese that take a long time to acquire.

To tackle this problem, I've developed a system from personal experience which focuses on three core kinds of practice:

- Listening practice
- Reading practice
- Vocab drilling

## Listening practice

In listening practice, you repeatedly listen to a video or piece of audio until you fullly understand it, with the goal of improving your listening comprehension. 

The selected audio or video material, which we’ll call “stories”, should meet these criteria:

- The stories should be monologues or dialogues by native speakers (not text-to-speech).
- The stories should have accurate transcripts.
- The stories should be [“comprehensible input”](https://ellevationeducation.com/blog/teaching-comprehensible-input-definition-examples), meaning content targeted for non-native speakers.
- The stories should range from 2 to 10 minutes long. (5 minutes is a good average. If you want to use longer content, break it into 5-10 minute chunks.)
- The stories should be sufficiently within your level that you understand at least 70-80% on your first listen. Generally this means each story will have no more than a handful of new words.

On average, you should repeat a story about 5 times, with the repetitions spaced out by a few days (so taking about 2 weeks in total for 5 repetitions).

After each repetition, you can look at the transcript if you need to verify your understanding and fill in gaps: lookup any unknown words, analyze the grammar, use machine translation, or whatever else it takes to fully understand the text.

If after 5 or so repetitions, you still can't fully understand the story, the story was probably too difficult for listening practice. If it takes only 1 or 2 repetitions, it was probably too easy.

## Reading practice

In reading practice, you repeatedly read the transcript of an audio or video story to get contextual exposure to new words, kanji, and language patterns. As you read, you look up every unknown word and puzzle out how all the words fit together, using translation tools and grammatical analysis or any other means necessary.

Rather than constantly pause and rewind the audio or video, you may prefer to let it play once through, follow the transcript as best you can, and then afterwards go back to the start to closely read the full transcript.

Like with listening practice, you should repeat each story about 5 times spread out over about 2 weeks, and the stories selected for reading practice should generally be comprehensible input that averages 5 minutes long (as read by a native speaker).

Unlike with listening practice, the stories should be significantly above your current level such that they include a good number of words and language patterns that you've never encountered before. For a 5 minute story, you roughly want 20-40 new words (and however many new kanji occur in those words).

Because you are studying the text rather than naturally reading it, reading practice is a slow process. For a story that is 5 minutes of audio, it often may take more than 30 minutes to get through, especially for the first repetition. The good news is that subsequent repetitions will go faster.

For both reading and listening practice, feel free to drop a story at any time because it’s too hard, too easy, too boring, or you just feel like doing something else. Keep in mind that **your attention and interest is critical in language acquisition, so you should follow your own impulses**.

## Vocab drilling

Follow three rules for drilling:

1. **Drill only words encountered recently in your listening and reading practice.** For words and kanji with multiple meanings and pronunciations, focus only on the meanings and pronunciations you've encountered in stories.
2. **Do not test yourself on the words**: drilling is an opportunity to get systematic repeated exposure, so just seeing and hearing the word with its definition is sufficient.
3. **Drill an individual word no more than 10-20 times total.** In fact, dropping a word from your drills after just 5 to 10 repetitions may be the optimum thing to do. You most likely won't master a word after just 5 drills or even 20 drills, but the goal of vocab drilling should not be to master words but rather to make the words more familiar.

Real mastery of words only comes through encounters in meaningful context, but by drilling words to a certain level of familiarity, each individual contextual encounter that follows becomes much more impactful. In other words, drilling a word 'primes' you for when you later encounter that word in your listening and reading practice or in the wild.

## Expectations

It's important to have the right expectations:

- For a long time, you wont understand most of what you encounter, and that which you do understand will often require conscious effort. “Natural” (automatic) understanding comes slowly and in pieces.
- As long as the language itself distracts you from focusing on the content of what you read and hear, your input consumption will be [*intensive* rather than *extensive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive_reading). This is not a matter of learning style or choice: the beginner simply cannot understand what they read or hear without looking up many words and pondering how the words fit together, a slow process which consumes much mental energy and greatly limits how much language content can be encountered per day.
- Comfort with a particular topic and style of content doesn’t necessarily translate to comfort with other topics or styles.
- Accept that it will typically require many exposures before a word or kanji is fully memorized. Instead of consciously trying to force memorization, you should lean heavily on tools that make it quick and easy to look up words and kanji. **Focus on reminders, not memorization.**
- A single aspect of a language cannot be truly mastered in isolation, and attempting to do so is generally inefficient. **Don’t try to master one aspect or “level” of the language before moving on.**

## Kana and Kanji

As for how to approach the writing system:

- Romaji is at best a temporary crutch. Within a few weeks, a beginner should be comfortable enough with hiragana to avoid romaji entirely.
- Katakana often remains troublesome for multiple years:
  - Several pairs of katakana characters are hard to distinguish because they look very similar.
  - Many Western import words spelt in katakana are considerably longer than most native Japanese words or Chinese import words.
  - Import words spelt in katakana often contain sequences of syllables that occur infrequently or not at all in native Japanese or Chinese import words.
  - The sounds of English import words are often distorted in surprising, inconsistent ways, making them strangely difficult for English speakers to read.
- Reading a word does not require “knowing” its kanji! In practice, most words spelt with kanji are recognized as a whole, not by their individual kanji. Instead of trying to memorize individual kanji on their own, you should focus on learning kanji in the context of the words you learn.
- There are tens of thousands of kanji that have been used throughout Japanese history, but only ~6000 kanji are used in modern Japanese with any frequency, and most native Japanese do not know all of these 6000. A typical educated native speaker can reliably read perhaps 3000-4000 kanji in the context of words and names, but the number of kanji they can recognize and define as isolated characters is somewhat smaller, and the number of kanji they can write by hand from memory is even smaller (say, perhaps, 2500 on the high end). **The most frequently used 1500-2000 kanji cover 99%+ of the kanji that occur in most modern Japanese writing. An additional 1000-1500 kanji cover most of the remaining 1%.**
- In theory, writing kanji by hand can help you memorize the characters, but whether this works in practice is debateable, and hand writting practice is very slow and tedious. Most people today rarely write any language by hand, including English, so learning to handwrite Japanese is probably not worth the effort unless you have a great interest in calligraphy.
- Like with words, you should learn kanji spellings of names as they come up. Don't try to systematically memorize nanori or the [jinmeiyou kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinmeiy%C5%8D_kanji).
- Being able to recognize kana and kanji in calligraphy and other stylized forms is a skill that requires its own practice. But until you reach the stage where you can fludily consume native content, trying to read calligraphy will just slow you down. Likewise, reading vertical text can induce mental overhead, so it's best avoided while you're still in beginner and intermediate stages.

## Random practice

In addition to systematic listening and reading practice, it's also good to consume content non-systematically with the goal of branching out and familiarizing yourself with parts of the language not usually found in comprehensible input.

So for random practice, you should consume audio, video, or text of various kinds and a variety of levels. Depending on the level, you may understand anywhere from 10% to 100% of what you consume. Reaching above your level exposes you to new vocabulary and grammar, while revisiting lower levels helps develop the ease and fluidity with which you process the language.

Unlike the systematic practice, you needn't repeat this random content, and for the most part, you should let anything you don't understand pass you by.

## Using TV and movies

In theory, TV shows and movies are a very appealing way to learn a language, but in practice, most TV and movies are inhospitable for beginner and intermediate learners due to several factors:

- Use of expansive vocabulary
- Use of advanced grammar
- Use of slang and colloquial speech
- Accents and speech quirks
- Archaic and formal speech
- Shouting, whispering, murmuring, mumbling
- Crosstalk
- Loud music and sound effects over dialogue

Subtitles alone are not a sufficient solution:

- A beginner or intermediate learner often won't know enough vocabulary or kanji to get even the gist of the story from Japanese subtitles.
- It's hard to concentrate on the Japanese audio while reading English subtitles (processing two languages at once is extremely difficult even if you already have mastered both languages). Furthermore, to the extent parts of a Japanese and English sentence correspond, they tend to do so in reverse order, so for longer sentences, the part of the dialogue currently displayed on screen often doesn't match what is currently being said. On top of this, translators often take large liberties, such that the subtitltes do not accurately convey the original meaning or the way in which the original meaning was expressed.
- Most video sources don't provide the option to display Japanese and English subtitles simulteously, and besides, processing two written languages adds even more mental overhead that distracts from listening.

Turning off subtitles isn't a solution either because a beginner or intermediate learner watching without subtitles would usually miss most of what is being said and wouldn't be able to follow the story.

Sadly then, you can't just watch TV and movies as normal to get much language value from them.

What you can do, though, is use ~5 minute excerpts from shows and movies as stories for repeated practice. The excerpts should generally have these qualities:

- Avoid the adverse factors listed above: heavy accents, use of slang, shouting, dialogue drowned out in the sound mix, *etc.*
- Accurate subtitles should be available in both Japanese and English, preferably in a form where both can be displayed simultaneously and where you can scan the transcripts.
- Look for extended dialogue scenes where the characters calmly take turns saying their lines.
- It helps if the dialogue scenes have a modicum of visual interest. The images don't actually have to relate directly to what's being said: rather, they just need to provide visual cues that help you track where you are in the conversation. Even just regular camera cuts between the characters can help a great deal.

Unfortunately, the TV and movies that fit these criteria may not be your favorites or even in your preferred genres. Particularly in anime, there's almost an inverse relationship between quality and appropriateness for learners: the better the anime, often the harder it is to understand due to diverse, complex dialogue, extended action set pieces with shouting and loud sounds and music, and other adverse qualities. So until you reach an advanced level, you may have to venture outside of your normal zone of interest to find appropriate content.

Because TV and movies are "native" content rather than "comprehensible input" designed explicitly for learners, they do not fit exactly in the listening and reading practice dichotomy. Even the easiest TV and movie content will generally have many new words and phrases for a beginner or intermediate learner, so you probably will need to fully analyze the transcript a few times to fully understand it. However, the whole point of using this content is for listening, so you should also watch each excerpted story multiple times without subtitles.

Full understanding may require more repetitions than normal listening practice, but feel free to drop a story once it bores you, even if you never fully "master" the content. For example, if you only understand 30% of a story on your first listen, maybe you'll understand 70-80% after several repetitions, but reaching 100% may require dozens of additional repetitions. Rather than bang your head against this wall, you're probably better off moving on to other content. Don't worry: the exercise still has great value even when you fall short of full understanding.

## Grammar study

The value of explicit grammar knowledge in acquiring a language is highly debated. The obvious demerits are:

- Conscious grammar knowledge does not really help you when listening or speaking in real time.
- A language's grammar tends to have many quirky edge cases, so some parts of grammar are messy and murky.
- Accurate, complete grammar information is hard to find.

On the plus side: 

- Grammar can help you understand things above your current "natural" comprehension level.
- Grammar can help you construct valid sentences above your "natural" speaking level. (This is not terribly useful when speaking but can help when writing.)
- Knowledge of grammar can give you comfort or even confidence by putting rational bounds on the language. Without any knowledge of grammar, a language seems choatic and untamable...which is partly true but by no means completely so.
- Many of the most common words in a language have *functions* more than *meanings*. For example in English, the articles "a" and "the" do not refer to any person, place, or thing like a noun, nor any action like a verb, nor even any manner or context of action like an adverb, and many other languages have no equivalents or near equivalents of articles. So good luck explaining these words without describing how they are used! To describe the functions of words is to explain grammar, so in some sense, at least basic grammar knowledge is inescapable.

My recommendation then is:

- DO learn grammatical concepts
- do NOT memorize grammatical facts and tables
- do NOT practice points of grammar

In other words, its useful to understand grammar as best you can, but attempting to memorize and practice gramar, such as verb conjugations, is more frustrating than helpful. Instead, you want to internalize grammar patterns through lots of repeated exposure to real language, *i.e.* lots of input. Only this kind of internalization will help you actually put grammar into practice.

## Language partners

An increasingly popular practice in recent years is pairing up with a "language partner", a native speaker of your target language who is also learning your native language. The usual idea is that language partners will meet (perhaps in person but more commonly online) on a regular basis and take turns holding a conversation in each other's languages.

This is surely a great way to practice speaking, but as discussed at the start, beginning and intermediate learners generally lack the required vocabulary and listening comprehension skills to even attempt holding a basic conversation.

An interesting question then is what else beginner and intermediate learners could do with a language partner that might be effective. An idea I've had&mdash;though it's not something I've tried and tested&mdash;is that, rather than holding conversations, language partners could instead do some kind of exercise or game that prompts them to communicate, but with both people only speaking their own native language. So rather than practicing speaking, the goal would be to just practice listening.

There are many possible exercises or games that might work well for this, but probably the simplest would be if both parties brought a story for the other person to read aloud. For example, if I bring my partner a story in Japanese, they would read it aloud to me sentence-by-sentence, and after each sentence, I would attempt to give them my translation in English. Both my partner and I could ask each other questions and prompt each other for clarification, but I would stick to speaking English while they speak Japanese (except perhaps when we prompt each other about specific words, *e.g.* 'What does X mean?'). Before moving on to the next sentence, we would check proper translations to make sure we both understood correctly.

This 'listening only' approach would have at least a few key advantages over conversation practice:

- Removing the requirement to speak the target language makes the activity more accessible at lower levels, and for many people it would probably induce less anxiety Finding a language partner is quite difficult, but lowering the skill requirements of both parties should make it considerably easier.
- Both participants get practice throughout the whole session, not just when the conversation switches to their target language. Even when my partner reads my story in Japanese, they are getting English input from me when I give my translation and ask them questions. Hopefully then they're less liable to feel impatient waiting for me to read their story in English.
