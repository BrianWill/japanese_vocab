## Input

The most important consideration for listening and reading practice is the difficulty of comprehension, which depends, of course, both on your own language skills and the particular content. Here are 5 levels of comprehension you'll experience as a learner, in order of least understanding to most understanding:

### 1. Scanning for words and phrases

At this level, you catch isolated words, phrases, and perhaps occasional whole clauses or sentences, and you may often recognize the 'outline' of many sentences (verb auxiliaries, conjunctions, and other connective words or phrases). However, you're not able to follow what's happening sentence-to-sentence nor consistently discern the topic. For example:

> *Something about a cow and magic beans. A giant is involved for some reason?*

### 2. Following the topic

You can follow the topic, but you're missing too many things to follow sentence-by-sentence:

> *Someone buys magic beans. There's a big plant, lots of climbing, and a castle. Also some clouds and a giant? Someone dies at the end?*

### 3. Partial understanding of the sentences

You can now understand the essence of many sentences, but details still get lost:

> *A kid gets magic beans. His mother is upset about the cow for some reason. Jack climbs a big plant that somehow appears. Jack finds a castle in the clouds and robs a giant, who dies when he falls.*

### 4. Full understanding of the sentences

You now catch basically all the information:

> *Oh I see, Jack traded the cow for the beans, and the plant grew from the beans which he tossed out the window. Jack stole the giant's goose, the giant chased him, and Jack killed the giant by chopping down the beanstalk.*

### 5. Full understanding of the nuance

You not only get all the concrete information conveyed, you understand the nuances like a native speaker. In Japanese, this would include things like the choice of end sentence particles or choice of pronouns or honorifics. (Japanese has a lot of 'coloring' options, meaning ways of changing the feel of what's being said without changing the concrete information conveyed.)

> *Jack is a disrepectful trickster comic hero who speaks in kansai dialect. The giant talks like a tough yakuza guy. The story is narrated from an authoritative, impartial, 3rd-person perspective,*

## Modes of input practice

1. Scanning
2. Intensive reading
3. Intensive listening: can mostly understand but following along with transcript to check understanding and occasionally stop to check words / translation.

## Selecting content

1. Consume content of varying difficulties. Use content within your level to reinforce what you've learned and develop fluidity. Use content above your level to acquire new words and language patterns. Content counts as "within your level" if you can understand it enough to stay engaged. You don't necessarily understand every word or sentence, but you can follow most of the core information being conveyed.
1. Ideally, all the content you consume has both audio and a full text transcript.
1. For content within your level, you should first listen without aid of transcript or subtitles, and then follow up by reading the transcript.
1. For content above your level, you should first read the transcript, looking up any unknown words and using machine translation as needed, and then you should follow up by listening to the audio, optionally reading along with the transcript or subtitles.
1. For longer pieces of content, break it into sections, e.g. a single chapter of a book or 10 minutes of a video. E.g. for a video above your level, you would read the transcript of the first 10 minutes before watching the first 10 minutes, then read the transcript of the second 10 minutes before watching the second 10 minutes, and so forth. 
1. If you repeat a piece of content, do so no more than a handful of times. It's tempting to think you can "master" comprehension of a piece of content with enough repetitions, but even to the extent this is possible, your time is better spent moving on to other things. If a piece of content is particularly interesting, repeat it only once or twice, then wait at least a few months before revisiting it again.


Ideally, comprehensible input content would be divided into fine-grained tiers:

- Each level would introduce a few hundred new words and several new points of grammar.
- In each tier, the content should focus on the new words and points of grammar while also reinforcing the words and grammar of the prior tiers. It would be OK if a piece of content includes a handful of words that are not in the vocabulary list, but grammar that hasn't yet been officially introduced should be strictly avoided.

Notes about listening and reading:

1. When listening, you should avoid stopping to check the transcript, look up words, or get a machine translation. Too much switching between listening and reading adds mental overhead and can significantly drag out the process.
1. Similarly, when reading you should avoid getting a machine translation after each sentence. Instead, you should read a significant chunk, say several sentences or paragraphs, and then if necessary get a machine translation of the whole chunk. Again, less frequent switching between reading the Japanese text and the translation avoids mental overhead and dragging out the process.


### TV and movies

In theory, TV shows and movies are a very appealing way to learn a language, but in practice, most TV and movies are inhospitable for beginner and intermediate learners due to several factors:

- Use of expansive vocabulary
- Use of advanced grammar
- Use of slang and colloquial speech
- Accents and speech quirks
- Archaic and formal speech
- Shouting, whispering, murmuring, mumbling
- Crosstalk
- Loud music and sound effects over dialogue

Furthermore, subtitles are problematic:

- A beginner or intermediate learner often won't know enough vocabulary or kanji to get even the gist of the story from Japanese subtitles.
- Just turning off subtitles isn't a great option either because a beginner or intermediate learners watching without subtitles would usually miss most of what is being said and wouldn't be able to follow the story.
- It's hard to concentrate on the Japanese audio while reading English subtitles (in fact, processing two languages at once is extremely difficult even if you already have mastered both languages). Furthermore, to the extent that parts of a Japanese and English sentence correspond, they tend to do so in reverse order, so for longer sentences, the part of the English translation currently displayed on screen often doesn't match what is currently being said in the Japanese audio. On top of this, translators often take large liberties, such that the English subtitles do not accurately convey the original meaning or the way in which the original meaning was expressed.
- Most video sources don't provide the option to display English and Japanese subtitles simultaneously, making it impossible to check the English subtitles for understanding while also checking the Japanese subtitles for words you missed. (Again though, exercising this option where available isn't optimal because processing two written languages adds even more mental overhead that distracts from listening.)

Sadly then, beginner and intermediate learners can't just watch TV and movies as normal for entertainment to get much language value from them. 

What can work, however, is using TV and movie excerpts for repeated listening and intensive reading practice. The chosen excerpts should generally have these qualities:

- The shorter the excerpt, the easier it is to repeat and the less liable you are to lose focus. Excerpts as short as 1 or 2 minutes may be appropriate. 
- Avoid the adverse factors listed above: heavy accents, use of slang, shouting, dialogue drowned out in the sound mix, *etc.* Look for dialogue scenes where the characters take turns saying their lines at a reasonable pace.
- Accurate subtitles should be available in both Japanese and English, preferably in a form where both can be displayed simultaneously and copy-pasted (useful when you want to get a machine translation).
- It helps if the dialogue scenes have a modicum of visual interest. The images don't actually have to relate directly to what's being said: rather, they just need to provide visual cues that help you track where you are in the dialogue. Even just regularly-paced camera cuts between the characters can help a great deal.

Unfortunately, the TV and movies that fit these criteria may not be your favorites or even in your preferred genres. Particularly in anime, there's almost an inverse relationship between quality and appropriateness for learners: the better the anime, often the harder it is to understand due to diverse, complex dialogue, extended action set pieces with shouting and loud sounds and music, and other learner-hostile qualities. So until you reach an advanced level, you may have to venture outside of your normal zone of interest to find appropriate content.

Because TV and movies are "native" content rather than "comprehensible input" designed explicitly for learners, they do not fit exactly in the listening and reading practice dichotomy. Even the easiest TV and movie content will generally have many new words and phrases for a beginner or intermediate learner, so you probably will need to fully analyze the transcript before or after listening.


## Reading while listening

Reading along with the transcript or subtitles as you listen can help you understand more and stay engaged with the content. However, keep in mind that fluent reading relies upon engaging the listening comprehension pathways in the brain. This implies:

1. Your reading fluency cannot exceed your listening comprehension.
2. When listening to something that you struggle to understand, reading along with a transcript is an *unnatural* act.

So it's critical to practice pure listening without text because the mental overhead of reading will distract your focus from the spoken language. Without listening-only practice, your listening comprehension development will be hindered or even stalled.

## Using AI translations and summaries

When tackling content that is above your level (mainly indicated by the content having a significant number of new or unfamiliar words), try first reading through an AI chat translation or English summary. Particularly for a piece of content which you have difficulty understanding, this trick helps you stay engaged as you listen: your memory of the summary will often fill in the gaps of understanding without having to stop and look up words or translate sentences.

On the other hand, this practice may actually *diminish* your engagement because it takes away the surprise of what comes next. So for some content, particularly fiction, you might instead only use AI summaries to *review* what you've read and listened to.


## Summary of listening and reading practice advice

- Prioritize listening practice over reading practice and especially speaking practice.
- Track the vocabulary you encounter in listening and reading.
- Limit vocabulary drills to words you have recently encountered in listening and reading, and limit lifetime drills of any individual word to 10-20 repetitions.
- If you repeat a piece of content, do so no more than a handful of times, even if you don't fully "master" it by the last repetition.
- For a long time, you wont understand most of what you encounter, and that which you do understand will often require conscious effort. “Natural”, automatic understanding comes only with massive consumption of the language, and still only then slowly and in pieces.
- As long as the language itself distracts you from focusing on the content of what you read and hear, your input consumption will be [*intensive* rather than *extensive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive_reading). This is not a matter of learning style or choice: the beginner simply cannot understand what they read or hear without looking up many words and consciously pondering how the words fit together, a slow process which consumes much mental energy and greatly limits how much language content can be encountered per day.
- Comfort with a particular topic and style of content doesn’t necessarily translate to comfort with other topics or styles. This can make it seem like your comprehension level has suddenly regressed when you've actually just stumbled out of your zone.
- Accept that it will typically require many exposures before a word or kanji is fully memorized. Instead of consciously trying to force memorization, you should lean heavily on tools that make it quick and easy to look up words and kanji. **Depend upon reminders, not memorization.**
- A single aspect of a language cannot be truly mastered in isolation, and attempting to do so is generally inefficient. **Don’t try to master one aspect or 'level' of the language before moving on.**
