## Input

The most important consideration for listening and reading practice is the difficulty of comprehension, which of course depends both on your own current language skills and the particular content. Here are 5 levels of comprehension you'll experience as a learner, in order of least understanding to most understanding:

### 1. Scanning for words and phrases

At this level, you catch isolated words, phrases, and perhaps occasional whole clauses or sentences. You also may often recognize the 'outline' of many sentences (verb auxiliaries, conjunctions, and other connective words or phrases) even when you're not able to grasp the overall meaning of most sentences or clauses. Even a clear idea of the topic may elude you.

> *Something about a cow and magic beans. A giant is involved for some reason?*

### 2. Following the topic

You can follow the topic, but you're missing too many things to follow sentence-by-sentence:

> *Someone buys magic beans. There's a big plant, lots of climbing, and a castle. Also some clouds and a giant? Someone dies at the end?*

### 3. Partial understanding of the sentences

You can now understand the essence of many sentences, but details still get lost:

> *A kid gets magic beans. His mother is upset about the cow for some reason. Jack climbs a big plant that somehow appears. Jack finds a castle in the clouds and robs a giant, who dies when he falls.*

### 4. Full understanding of the sentences

You now catch basically all the information:

> *Oh I see, Jack traded the cow for the beans, and the plant grew from the beans which he tossed out the window. Jack stole the giant's goose, the giant chased him, and Jack killed the giant by chopping down the beanstalk.*

### 5. Full understanding of the nuance

You not only get all the concrete information conveyed, you understand the nuances like a native speaker. In Japanese, this would include things like the choice of end sentence particles or choice of pronouns or honorifics. (Japanese has a lot of 'coloring' options, meaning ways of changing the feel of what's being said without changing the concrete information conveyed.)

> *Jack is a disrepectful trickster comic hero who speaks in kansai dialect. The giant talks like a tough yakuza guy. The story is narrated from an authoritative, impartial, 3rd-person perspective,*

## Modes of input practice

Listening and reading should be your primary form of language practice, but there are different ways of consuming input. Each "mode" of input practice has its strengths and weaknesses, so to make efficient progress, you should do a balanced mix of them all.

### "Natural" mode

In the "natural" mode, you read or listen with an expectation of understanding the large majority of what you read or hear *without* need of analysis. Generally you won't pause or rewind the recordings, and you'll avoid looking up words or using machine translation. 

For this kind of exercise, the content should comfortably be within your level of comprehension. Though it's fine if some words are less familiar or totally unknown, such words should occur at sufficiently low frequency that you can usually fill in the gaps from the surrounding context. Most importantly, you should be able to understand enough to stay engaged with the content.

### "Scanning" mode

In the "scanning" mode, you listen or read without expecting to understand many of the full sentences or even clauses, and you don't even expect to necessarily discern the topic. Instead you focus on just catching as much as you can, even if that's just individual words. 

Scanning is generally only appropriate with content that is significantly above your level, which will typically use a much wider diversity of words than easier material. Many of the words you won't know at all, but many will be medium- and low-frequency words which are vaguely familiar to you, and therein lies the main value of scanning: it gives you contextual encounters with these medium- and low-frequency words at a rate that will reinforce and increase their familiarity.

On the downside, scanning can be quite mentally exhausting, especially when you're only picking out fragments and individual words. It's a valuable form of exercise, but you should probably do no more than 10 or 15 minutes per day.

### "Analysis" mode

In the "analysis" mode, you read a text or transcript, using any tools required to understand it word-for-word, clause-by-clause. You should look up any unknown words and kanji, use machine translation on any unparsable clauses or sentences, and ask AI chatbots to explain any confusing grammar or word use.

The big upside of analysis is that it allows you to grasp the meaning of content that may contain many unknown words and grammar.

The main downside of analysis is that it's slow and taxing: retrieving definitions, translations, and grammar explanations incurs overhead, both on your time and your attention. It's also the case that conscious analysis of words and sentences is an unnatural way of consuming language input and so is not a proper exercise of your natural language faculties.

Here are a few tricks to reduce the mental and time overhead of analysis:

- Take the text in larger chunks. Rather than stopping to analyze each sentence, you should instead read a chunk of several sentences or more before attempting to analyze the whole chunk.
- Ask an AI chatbot for an English summary of a large chunk *before* reading it. This will give you context that often allows you to make educated guesses about the unknown or unfamiliar words and about the sentences that would otherwise be difficult to parse. The more you understand in your first pass read through a chunk, the less analysis overhead it will require. (On the other hand, pre-reading summaries may actually *diminish* your engagement, particularly with fiction, because it takes away the surprise of what comes next.)
- When analyzing the transcript of audio or video, you should generally wait to listen or watch the whole thing after going through the complete transcript. Otherwise, if you switch back and forth between the transcript and recording, this switching itself induces overhead that further slows down the process. (Note that, unless the content is within or close your natural level, you should read the transcript or subtitles as you play the recording.)
- Another way to "preload context" is to revisit something already known to you. For example, you can analyze the transcript of a memorable movie or TV show episode that you watched months or years before.


## TV and movies

In theory, TV shows and movies are a very appealing way to learn a language, but in practice, most TV and movies are inhospitable for beginner and intermediate learners due to several factors:

- Use of expansive vocabulary
- Use of advanced grammar
- Use of slang and colloquial speech
- Accents and speech quirks
- Archaic and formal speech
- Shouting, whispering, murmuring, mumbling
- Crosstalk
- Loud music and sound effects over dialogue

Furthermore, subtitles are problematic:

- A beginner or intermediate learner often won't know enough vocabulary or kanji to get even the gist of the story from Japanese subtitles.
- Just turning off subtitles isn't a great option either because a beginner or intermediate learners watching without subtitles would usually miss most of what is being said and wouldn't be able to follow the story.
- It's hard to concentrate on the Japanese audio while reading English subtitles (in fact, processing two languages at once is extremely difficult even if you already have mastered both languages). Furthermore, to the extent that parts of a Japanese and English sentence correspond, they tend to do so in reverse order, so for longer sentences, the part of the English translation currently displayed on screen often doesn't match what is currently being said in the Japanese audio. On top of this, translators often take large liberties, such that the English subtitles do not accurately convey the original meaning or the way in which the original meaning was expressed.
- Most video sources don't provide the option to display English and Japanese subtitles simultaneously, making it impossible to check the English subtitles for understanding while also checking the Japanese subtitles for words you missed. (Again though, exercising this option where available isn't optimal because processing two written languages adds even more mental overhead that distracts from listening.)

Sadly then, beginner and intermediate learners can't get much language value from TV and movies as "natural" input. Instead, this content can only effectively be consumed with analysis.


## Comprehensible input





Ideally, comprehensible input content would be divided into fine-grained tiers:

- Each level would introduce a few hundred new words and several new points of grammar.
- In each tier, the content would focus on the tier's new words and points of grammar while also reinforcing the prior tiers. Each piece of content may use a handful of words from outside the vocabulary list, but grammar that hasn't officially introduced is strictly avoided.
