    <h2>Importing</h2>

    <div class="import_instructions">
        Stories are imported in sets called "sources", which are represented as directories directly under the
        "sources" directory. For example, the directory "sources/example" represents a source named
        "example".
    </div>

    <div class="import_instructions">
        In a source directory, each mp3 and mp4 file represents an individual story. For a story named `thing.mp3` or
        `thing.mp4`, the English and Japanese VTT subtitle files in the same directory should be named, respectively,
        `thing.en.vtt` and `thing.ja.vtt`.
    </div>

    <div class="import_instructions">
        This import page lists all detected source directories. Clicking the `import` button of a source imports or
        re-imports all the stories in that source. (Re-importing a story reprocesses its subtitle files.)
    </div>

    <div class="import_instructions">
        WARNING: Importing each story, say a typical 30 minute episode of a TV show, may take a couple seconds, so
        sources with many stories may take minutes.
