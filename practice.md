# How to practice Japanese

We'll evaluate five kinds of language practice:

1. Immersion
2. Grammar study
3. Drilling
4. Tutors and language partners (live speaking and listening practice)
5. Input (reading and listening)

## Immersion

A shipwreck survivor washes ashore in an unfamiliar land, taken in by a remote village that exclusively speaks another language. Cut off entirely from outside contact, the stranger's every conversation, every request for food, every shared task must happen in the villagers’ tongue. There are no translation apps, no bilingual dictionaries&mdash;only gestures, trial and error, and the pressing need to understand and be understood. The stranger must communication to survive, but this motivation drives them to acquire conversational proficiency in months, rather than years, enabled by the omni-presence and omni-necessity of the new language. This is the ideal scenario for second language acquisition: rare, extreme, and almost impossible to replicate in modern life.

Of course, children acquiring their first language naturally experience an immersion scenario like that of the shipwrecked stranger, which is why almost all children reliably acquire their first language with seemingly no deliberate effort. However, an adult or teenager learning a second language cannot simply recreate comparable conditions. A child grows up surrounded by native speakers who constantly address them, simplify their speech, and give the child daily opportunities for social interaction within the target language community. The child is dependent on the language to get their needs met, and they have years to absorb it without any expectation from others of high comprehension or sophisticated production. In contrast, anyone past childhood will rarely receive the same kind of constant, patient, simplified input, nor will they commonly be given social permission to insert themselves into a peer group of native speakers and learn by osmosis.

Not only is it impossible to replicate the conditions of childhood, modern life rarely strips away access to your native language, and most people cannot completely sever ties with their existing social and professional networks. Although access to Japanese media is more plentiful than ever online, there are still very few opportunities outside Japan for true immersion, such as natural face-to-face conversation or incidental communication.  Even living in Japan does not fully solve this problem, as it’s common for a foreigner to spend much of their day in English-speaking workplaces, socializing with other expatriates, or retreating to native-language media after hours. So even in the best circumstances, the inescapable necessity that drives rapid language acquisition isn't practical in the life circumstances of most people.

To be clear, immersion, to the extent it can be approximated in your life, is extremely valuable, but outside of very special living situations, a learner will not get very far without other forms of practice.

## Grammar study

The value of explicit grammar knowledge in acquiring a language is highly debated. The obvious demerits are:

- Conscious thinking about grammar while speaking or listening requires too much mental overhead and in fact steals your focus while you're trying to speak or understand.
- The grammar of all natural human languages have parts that are messy and murky.
- Accurate, complete grammar information is hard to find.

On the plus side: 

- When reading, grammar can help you break down sentences to understand things above your current "natural" comprehension level.
- When writing, grammar can help you construct valid sentences above your "natural" speaking level.
- Knowledge of grammar can give you comfort or even confidence by putting rational bounds on the language. Without any knowledge of grammar, a language seems chaotic and untamable.
- Many of the most common words in a language have *functions* more than *meanings*. For example in English, the articles "a" and "the" do not refer to any person, place, or thing like a noun, nor any action like a verb, nor even any manner or context of action like an adverb, and many other languages have no equivalents or near equivalents of articles. So good luck explaining these words without describing how they are used! To describe the functions of words is to explain grammar, so in some sense, at least basic grammar knowledge is inescapable.

My recommendation then is:

- DO learn grammatical concepts
- do NOT memorize grammatical facts and tables
- do NOT practice points of grammar

In other words, its useful to understand grammar as best you can, but attempting to memorize and practice grammar, such as verb conjugations, is more frustrating than helpful. Instead, you want to internalize grammar patterns through lots of repeated exposure to real language, *i.e.* lots of input. Only this kind of internalization will help you actually put grammar into practice, both for the sake of input and output.

## Drilling

For drilling, follow four rules:

1. **Drill only the words that you have encountered recently in listening or reading.**
2. **For words and kanji with multiple meanings and pronunciations, focus only on the meanings and pronunciations used in the stories.**
3. **Do not 'test' yourself on the words**. Drilling is an opportunity to get systematic repeated exposure, so just seeing and hearing words with their definitions is what provides the value.
4. **Drill an individual word no more than 10-20 times total in your lifetime.** You most likely won't master a word after just 10 to 20 drills, but the goal of vocab drilling should not be to *master* words but rather to make the words more *familiar*.

Real mastery of words only comes through encounters in meaningful context, but by drilling words to a certain level of familiarity, each subsequent individual contextual encounter becomes much more impactful. In other words, drilling a word can 'prime' you for when you later encounter it in your listening or reading practice or in the wild.

Ideally, you track all of the words you encounter in your listening and reading. When a word becomes reasonably well-known to you (but not necessarily mastered), you should mark the word in your tracked set as "archived". This kind of tracking thus allows you to:

1. Assemble words to drill from your unarchived word set.
1. Assess the difficulty of a piece of content based on the number and proportion of new or unarchived words it contains.
1. Track your progress in the language by the total number of words you have encountered and the number you have archived.

## Language partners

An increasingly popular practice in recent years is pairing up with a "language partner", a native speaker of your target language who is also learning your native language. The usual idea is that language partners will meet on a regular basis and take turns holding a conversation in each other's languages.

This is surely a great way to practice speaking, but beginning and even intermediate learners generally lack the required vocabulary and listening comprehension skills to even attempt holding a basic conversation.

An interesting question then is what else beginner and intermediate learners could do with a language partner that might be effective. One possibility other than holding *conversations* is to instead do some kind of exercise or game that prompts *communication* with a language partner in which *both people only speaking their own native language*. Rather than practice speaking, the idea would be to just practice listening.

There are many possible exercises or games that might work well for this, but probably the simplest would be if both parties brought a story for the other person to read aloud. For example, if I bring my partner a story in Japanese, they would read it aloud to me sentence-by-sentence, and after each sentence, I would attempt to give them my translation in English. Both my partner and I could ask each other questions and prompt each other for clarification, but I would stick to speaking English while they speak Japanese (except perhaps when we prompt each other about specific words, *e.g.* 'What does Japanese word "X" mean?'). Before moving on to the next sentence, we would check a proper translation to make sure we both understood correctly.

This listening-only approach would have at least a few key advantages over conversation practice:

- Removing the requirement to speak the target language makes the activity more accessible at lower levels, and for many people it would induce much less anxiety.
- One reason finding a language partner is quite difficult is because it requires that both people are ready to start speaking, something which takes several months or more of study. In contrast, basic listening is something that learners can try in the first month or even on the first day.
- Both participants get practice throughout the whole session, not just when the conversation switches to their target language. Even when my partner reads my story in Japanese, they are getting English input from me when I give my translation and ask them questions. Hopefully then they're less liable to feel impatient while waiting for me to read their story in English.
