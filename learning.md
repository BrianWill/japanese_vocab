# How to learn Japanese

There are two key milestones on the path to acquiring a second language:

- First is the comprehension milestone, the point at which you are able to consume interesting content (text, audio, video, etc.) in the target language with a sufficient degree of understanding and fluidity to stay engaged with it.
- Second is the speaking milestone, the point at which you have sufficient listening skills and vocabulary to attempt non-trivial spoken communication.

The speaking milestone follows comprehension because speaking rests upon a foundation of listening comprehension.

How long it takes to reach these milestones depends upon the distance between your own language and the target language. For a Spanish speaker learning Italian or *vice versa*, these milestones can be reached in perhaps just a few months. For an English speaker learning Japanese or *vice versa*, this usually takes multiple years.

Once you reach these two milestones, the path forward is clear: consume tons of content and do lots of speaking practice. The hard question, though, is how to reach these milestones in the first place, especially for languages like Japanese that take a long time to acquire.

## General points

To reach these goals, you of course must practice, but how exactly? We'll discuss that in [the next part](/practice.md), but first, here are some premises to keep in mind:

➣ Speaking proficiency rests on a foundation of listening comprehension. In terms of vocabulary, the direct connection in our brains between the sound and meaning of a word is formed by experiencing that connection many, many times when spoken by others. Without this direct connection, words will not come to us quickly and naturally enough when we need to use them. In terms of grammar, fluent speaking entails imitation of patterns we have absorbed from many, many instances spoken by others. Effectively then, we can't say things which we can't understand. 

➣ Fully fluent reading requires both listening proficiency and speaking proficiency. Natural, fluent reading is partly a simulation of speech&mdash;the reader activates a speaking voice in their head&mdash;and as we just established, speaking rests on a foundation of listening.

➣ For a long time, you wont understand most of what you encounter, and that which you do understand will often require conscious effort. “Natural”, automatic understanding comes only with massive consumption of the language, and still only then slowly and in pieces.

➣ As long as the language itself distracts you from focusing on the content of what you read and hear, your input consumption will be [*intensive* rather than *extensive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive_reading). This is not a matter of learning style or choice: the beginner simply cannot understand what they read or hear without looking up many words and consciously pondering how the words fit together. Consuming input intensively is a slow process which consumes much mental energy and greatly limits how much language content can be encountered per day, but this intensive phase of learning cannot be fully skipped.

➣ Comfort in a language with a particular topic and style of content doesn’t necessarily translate to comfort with other topics or styles. If you wander outside of your comfort zone, you may feel like your comprehension level has suddenly regressed, even when that is most likely not the case.

➣ Full memorization of a word or kanji will typically require many exposures. Instead of consciously trying to force memorization, you should lean heavily on tools that allow you to quickly and easily look up words and kanji. In other words, the best strategy is to **depend upon reminders, not memorization.**

➣ A single aspect of a language cannot be truly mastered in isolation. For example, learners commonly have difficulty with multi-digit numbers, so they often practice numbers as an isolated skill. While this kind of focused practice can have some benefits, it's a mistake to expect that it will imbue mastery. The full development and maintenance of language skills requires an enormous amount of repetitive and contextual reinforcement that can only be delivered by real, practical use of the language. If you get stuck practicing isolated features of a language, that effort will largely end up wasted.

➣ Similarly, you should not expect to master a 'level' of the language before moving on. For example, when learners reach a point where they feel quite familiar with the vocabulary and grammar of the N5 and N4 levels of JLPT, understanding and using Japanese of this level still typically require conscious effort. Because the portion of Japanese they've so far acquired does not yet feel 'natural', learners often get stuck fixated on refining their mastery of this subset of the language rather than moving on. This is a mistake. Again, the full development and maintenance of language skills requires an enormous amount of repetitive and contextual reinforcement that can only be delivered by real, practical use of the language. The challenge for learners, then, is that they must reach a point of critical mass where they have enough vocabulary and grammar for the language to be useful for them. Only then can they engage enough with the language to develop any real mastery.


## Word acquisition

Acquisition of a new word broadly follows this sequence:

### 1. Acquire a phonetic memory of a word

Human brains are remarkably good at absorbing the unique sound signatures of words. Often it takes hearing a word just a handful of times before you can fairly reliably recognize the sound of a word when you hear it, even mixed into sentences that otherwise consist of totally unknown words. 

However, recognizing the sound of a word does not mean you necessarily understand it. That comes later.

Nor does recognizing the sound of a word translate automatically to recognizing the written form or being able to *reproduce* the sound reliably. For example, even if you reliably recognize 面白い when you hear it, you may not reliably be able to remember the exact sequence of syllables when you try to speak the word. So even though speaking is built on a foundation of listening, reliably speaking a word correctly generally takes some actual speaking practice.

### 2. Acquire a mapping from the phonetic memory to the meaning of a word

Although conscious recall of a word's meaning has some value in the learning process, ultimately, fluent listening comprehension requires direct, automatic mapping from the sound of a word to its meaning.

The only way to form these direct connections in your brain is to *experience* the meaning of a word when you hear it. The experiences do not have to be sensory (though that can help): rather the experiences can simply be occurances where you are *engaged* with the meaning *as you hear the word*.

Artificial encounters with words, such as in drills, generally lack this engagement: you can consciouly note that アライグマ means "racoon", and with enough repetitions you can recall this fact when prompted, yet the direct connection between the sound and meaning will only be formed by experiencing アライグマ in a meaningful context. These contexts could be:

- Seeing an アライグマ when someone says, "アライグマ！"
- Being advised to keep your garbage bins sealed to ward off アライグマ.
- Hearing an engrossing fable about an アライグマ.
- Etc.

The critical part is that the meaning of the word has immediate value to you in these situations, such that you are really paying attention and actually care in the moment what this arbitrary sound means.

### 3. Acquire nuances of a word

Beyond the "simple" meanings, words often have many nuances: shades of meaning, connotations, and colocations. The only practical way to acquired these nuances is simply by listening to and reading a ton of the language.

### 4. Acquire active use of a word

Finally, a word will eventually move from your passive vocabularly into your active vocabulary. Again, the only practical way to induce this is through lots of speaking practice, and no artificial exercise is better than conversation and other scenarios where you genuinely need to communicate.

(Note that this last step often overlaps the prior: at the same time as you're integrating a word into your active vocabulary, you're often also still picking up its nuances.)


## Translating in your head

A common lament of language learners is that they feel stuck "translating in their head" as they read, listen, or speak rather than the being able to use the language automatically without effort like their own native language. Unfortunately, there's no mental techinique that will help you consciouly stop yourself from doing this mental translation. The only fix is just more practice: more listening, more reading, and more speaking. Eventually you'll stop translating in your head because you will no longer need to.

For individual words and phrases, there is often an in-between phase, where the meaning of a word you hear does not fully register automatically, so you consciously repeat the word to yourself but don't actually translate it.

Again, word acquisition starts with just phonetic recognition without understanding of the meaning:

> おんがく? I've heard that word

Then comes conscious recognition with translation:

> おんがく? That means "music"

Then comes conscious recognition:

> おんがく? Oh yeah, おんがく

Finally, once a word is fully in your passive vocabulary, the meaning will register automatically when you hear it without any conscious thought:

> おんがく

It's common to have a large set of words that seem stuck in the earlier stages, but understand that this is normal. Don't get frustrated when you catch yourself consciously thinking about a word when you hear it even if it's a word you've heard a thousand times already. Some words will just take longer than others.

In fact, until you can listen to interesting content with a high degree of comprehension, many words will probably hover at the border of this final threshold. Only once the language is really useful to you such that you can actually consume content for the content's own sake rather than language practice will the vocabulary and language patterns become truly ingrained.
