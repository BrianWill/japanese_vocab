# Japanese Language Acquisition: The Writing System

## Why is the Japanese writing system difficult to learn?

The Japanese writing system is difficult to learn due to a few factors.

First, of course, is the large number of characters:

- **hiragana**, a set of phonetic characters consisting of about 50-100 characters (depending what you count as a distinct character)
- **katakana**, a correponding set of phonetic characters (which is in principle redundant but which in practice is used for writing foreign words and a few other special purposes)
- **kanji**, the ideographic Chinese characters, of which there are about 3000+ commonly known by most Japanese speakers

Second, unlike in Chinese languages (Mandarin, Cantonese, et al.), most of the Japanese kanji have multiple pronunciations, and which pronunciation is used in which words mostly just has to be memorized per word.

Third, many words have alternate spellings with different mixes of kana and kanji or different kanji entirely. In particular, many of the most common verbs can be splet with two or three different kanji.

Fourth, Japanese does not put spaces between its words, so just distinguishing where one word ends and the next begins is its own challenge. Ultimately, discerning individual words in Japanese text relies upon solid knowledge of the written vocabulary and an internalized feel for the grammar and language patterns.

Fifth, certain details of pronunciations are not indicated in the text, including:

- pitch accent (which is somewhat analogous to "stress accent" in English)
- blending, *e.g.* whether to ellide the "u" in "su", as is done in some words

So like English, Japanese writing doesn't tell the reader *exactly* how to pronounce the words. Instead, the reader just has to already know.

## Do I really need to *read* Japanese?

If your primary interest in Japanese is *speaking*, you might question whether learning to read Japanese is strictly essential, or maybe you wonder if you can get away with learning the spoken language first before dealing with the written language.

Never learning to read is a bad idea, primarily because reading is a key vector for acquiring many, many vocabulary words that otherwise don't come up in most day-to-day speech. In a modern literate society, a large chunk of vocabulary is only acquired and maintainted through reading. So while listening and speaking practice can make you *functional* in the language, you'll probably lack the vocabulary for many conversations and situations without reading.

As for waiting to learn reading until after learning the spoken language, this too is usually a bad idea for most people because reading can be an extremely useful tool while learning the spoken language. Unlike spoken language, written language allows you to take it at your own pace and scan back and forth through the words. Most importantly, you can much more easily and conveniently look up unknown written words than unknown spoken words.

## Downsides and limitations of reading

As valuable as reading can be, understand that reading alone is not sufficient for learning a language. 

First, the human language faculty is wired for listening, not reading. Unlike listening, reading is in a sense an "unnatural" mental activity that requires special practice and incurs significant mental overhead . 

Second, the natural language processing that occurs when listening is essentially sequential. Reading, however, allows you to take the words of sentences out of order. So while reading which is slow and halting is still a good way to engage with vocabulary, such reading isn't necessarily properly engaging and exercising your natural language processing. Until you can read with reasonable fluency, you'll need to focus on listening practice to develop your comprehension.

Third, typical speech has many inflectional and emotive cues that text does not, and these cues can greatly aid your comprehension.

Fourth, only listening to native speakers can convey proper pronunciation. Too much reading without listening might instil bad pronunciation habits.

Fifth, according to the best research, fluent reading is mapped through phonemes, meaning that fluent reading relies upon triggering phonetic memories of the words. Surprisingly, this finding applies to Japanese even though its writing is not fully phonetic. The implication is that you cannot fluently read Japanese until you already have advanced listening (and possibly also speaking?) skills. Until then, your reading will remain at least partly halting and labored no matter how well you know the characters.

## Do I really need to *write* Japanese?

In theory, writing kana and kanji by hand can help you memorize the characters, but whether this actually works in practice is questionable, and handwriting practice is extremely slow and tedious.

Besides, most people today rarely write *their own native language* by hand, so learning to handwrite Japanese is probably not worth the effort unless you have a great interest in calligraphy.

## How should I learn kana?

Romaji is at best a temporary crutch. 

the kana characters can be learned (but not mastered) in just a few weeks through drilling

Drill hiragana and katakana to learn the characters, but develop fluid kana reading through real words and sentences. Within a few weeks, a beginner should be comfortable enough with hiragana to avoid romaji entirely.

Katakana often remains troublesome for multiple years:

  - Several pairs of katakana characters are hard to distinguish because they look very similar.
  - Many Western import words spelt in katakana are considerably longer than most native Japanese words or Chinese import words.
  - Import words spelt in katakana often contain sequences of syllables that occur infrequently or not at all in native Japanese or Chinese import words.
  - The sounds of English import words are often distorted in surprising, inconsistent ways, making them strangely difficult for English speakers to read.

Consequently, don't expect reading katakana words to be easy and fluent until you are well advanced into the language (meaning able to listen to and understand native or near-native content).

## How should I learn kanji?

Can I just learn all of the kanji “up front” by brute force?

why is this a bad idea?

at most, memorize 200-300 kanji by brute force, but then just focus on vocabulary and absorb the kanji as they come up in the vocabulary.

- Reading a word does not require “knowing” its kanji! In practice, most words spelt with kanji are recognized as a whole, not by their individual kanji. Instead of trying to memorize individual kanji on their own, you should focus on learning kanji in the context of the words you learn.
- There are tens of thousands of kanji that have been used throughout Japanese history, but only ~6000 kanji are used in modern Japanese with any frequency, and most native Japanese do not know all of these 6000. A typical educated native speaker can reliably read perhaps 3000-4000 kanji in the context of words and names, but the number of kanji they can recognize and define as isolated characters is somewhat smaller, and the number of kanji they can write by hand from memory is even smaller (say, perhaps, 2500 on the high end). **The most frequently used 1500-2000 kanji cover 99%+ of the kanji that occur in most modern Japanese writing. An additional 1000-1500 kanji cover most of the remaining 1%.**
- Like with words, you should learn kanji spellings of names as they come up. Don't try to systematically memorize nanori or the [jinmeiyou kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinmeiy%C5%8D_kanji).

## Should I study caligraphy?

Being able to recognize kana and kanji in calligraphy and other stylized forms is a skill that requires its own practice, but until you reach the stage where you can fludily consume native content, trying to read calligraphy will just slow you down.

Likewise, reading vertical text can induce mental overhead, so it's best avoided while you're still in beginner and intermediate stages.

## Summarized advice

- Drill hiragana and katakana to learn the characters (but understand that fluid kana reading will only develop through reading lots of real words and sentences).
- Don’t drill kanji: absorb kanji from words
- Stick to plain, horizontal, non-caligraphy text. The ability to read fancy text can be much more easily acquired once you can already fluidly read plain text.
- Don’t expect to be able to read fluidly (esp katakana and kanji) until you have a quite lage vocabulary and advanced listening comprehension skills.
